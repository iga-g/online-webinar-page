# Online webinar website

Project based on layout which I made on Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/file/gcrS9qLM8CB5b0odvZYuWh/Webinar-page).
I wanted to practice design, variables in css and cool inputs. Also used a little page transition.

## Roadmap

I would like to add burger for nav to make it fully responsive menu. Also I want to develop my skills with forms.
