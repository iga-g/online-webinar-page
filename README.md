# online-webinar-page
Project based on layout which I made on figma (here: https://www.figma.com/file/gcrS9qLM8CB5b0odvZYuWh/Webinar-page).
I wanted to practice design, variables in css and cool inputs. Also used a little page transition. 
Project for desktop, needs media queries beyond 765px width.
